# _Parcels_

#### By Eliot Gronstal

#### _A website for a fictional shipping company that helps users calculate shipping estimates. Made for Epicodus Coding School during Week 2 of C#._

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.NET_
* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _MSTest_

## Description

* _Create a Parcel class and test it thoroughly. It contains a constructor, and getters and setters for each property. You are able to create a new parcel and specify the dimensions and weight in the arguments._

* _Create a website where the user can submit a form with the dimensions and weight of a Parcel, and you can use the data in the form to instantiate a Parcel object and display its dimensions and weight._

* _When you call a method called Volume() on a Parcel instance, it should return the product of the sides._

* _When you call a CostToShip() method on your parcel, return a cost based on a formula you make up._

* _Display the cost to ship and the volume of a Parcel with its dimensions in your site._

* _Bonus: Add validation and make sure the Parcel object is not created if any of the form fields are blank. Display an error message instead. Also make sure your user can only enter numbers into the form._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repo._
* _Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "ProjectName"._
* _In the command line, run the command ``dotnet run`` to compile and execute the console application. Since this is a console application, you'll interact with it through text commands in your terminal._
* _Optionally, you can run ``dotnet build`` to compile this console app without running it._
* _If we want to run our project in production mode with a watcher, we can use a command line flag to specify that we want to run the "production" profile. ``dotnet watch run --launch-profile "production"``_
*  _Open the browser to [https://localhost:5001]. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate.](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/basic-web-applications/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate)_

## Test Instructions

* _Using a shell program, navigate from the root directory, "ClassName.Solution," to the "ClassName.Tests" directory._
* _Once in the "ClassName.Tests" directory, type ``dotnet restore`` into the console._
* _After the restore process is complete, type ``dotnet test`` into the console. This will run all written tests and display the test results into the console to review._

## Known Bugs
